OSI model 
open systems interconnection 

1. application layer eg - SMTP TELLNET DNS
2. presentation layer -> translation , encryption , compression eg- SSL HTTP
3. session layer -> endpoints 
4. transport layer -> UDP TCP
5. network layer -> router , logical addressing(IP addressing) -> packets recived 
6. Data link layer -> physical addressing (mac addressing) -> converted to frames 
7. Physiscal layer -> wires and all

tcp/ip  model -> 
5 layers 
1. application 
2. transport 
3. network 
4. datalink 
5. physical 

protocalls ->  common rules to communicate 

1 APPLication layer -> end user intract with this layer 

P2P -> peer to peer ->  no 1 dedicated server 
every system is client as server both
decentralised network 


bridge ->  repeater that can filter out things 
gateway -> connect to neworks 

socket -> interface betwen a process and the internet 
used in IPC 
named contact points between two processes 

ports -> ephermal ports -> client side -> random port numbers assigned then de-assigned

http -> use tcp (in transport layer)
do not store the state
